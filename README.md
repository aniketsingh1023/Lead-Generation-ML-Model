# Project Name

## Description
This project is a Python-based application that utilizes machine learning libraries to perform data analysis and predictions. The project includes various models such as XGBoost  and uses data visualization tools like Matplotlib.

## Requirements

To set up the project environment, follow the instructions below.

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

1. **Install Python** (if not installed): Ensure that you have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   
   - **On Windows**:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. **Install the required packages**:

   Once the virtual environment is activated, install the dependencies using `pip` from the `requirements.txt` file:

   - First, create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

     ```
     numpy==1.20.0
     pandas==1.2.4
     matplotlib==3.7.1
     scikit-learn==0.24.1
     xgboost==1.6.2
     lightgbm==3.3.2
     ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install all the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
